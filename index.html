      What is Lorem Ipsum?<br />
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      <br />
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the<br />
      What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
      and<br />
      typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
      dummy<br />
      text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
      type<br />
      and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only<br />
      five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
      remaining<br />
      essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
      of<br />
      Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with<br />
      desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of<br />
      Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a
      reader<br />
      will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
      its<br />
      layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less<br />
      normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
      content<br />
      here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing<br />
      packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
      model<br />
      text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still
      in<br />
      their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes
      by<br />
      accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where
      does<br />
      it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
      random<br />
      text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,<br />
      making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at<br />
      Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure<br />
      Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through<br />
      the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
      undoubtable<br />
      source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de
      Finibus<br />
      Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written
      in<br />
      45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular<br />
      during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
      dolor<br />
      sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk
      of<br />
      Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
      interested.<br />
      Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by<br />
      Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by<br />
      English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. 1500s, when
